Below is a list questions asked by the students during lectures or LAB sessions, some of the questions are imaginary others are actual questions asked by students.

- What is the expected outcome of this course?
- At the end of this course you should be able to:
  1. Understand what are digital systems and how are they designed.
  2. Understand the different implementation options for digital systems.
  3. Be able to use a hardware description language (Verilog) to design simple to moderate digital systems.
  4. Be able to verify digital systems functionality by writing test-benches.
  5. Understand timing constraints for digital systems.
  6. Understand finite state machines.
  7. Understand what is meant by datapaths and control units.
  8. Understand IO and IO-controllers.
  

- How can I succeed in the course?
- There are a number of advices that can help you succeed in this course:
  1. Don't miss the class and LAB sessions.
  2. Ask questtion when you don't understand somthing, you can send your questions to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dsd-with-verilog-hdl
  3. Do the reading and solve the homework assignments.
  4. Practice writing Verilog codes regularly.
  
- Can I use the knowleged I gain in this course to build a product such as a mobile phone or a TV set?
- No, these are finished products that require knowledge beyond the scope of this course, these products are usually built by teams of engineers and desingers with a diverse backgrounds and expertise.
What you can build using the knowleged gained from this course are prototypes and digital subsystems that might be part of a final product,
to get an idea of what you can build using Verilog visit: https://opencores.org/projects.

- Is writing Verilog codes the same as programming an Arduino or a microcontroller?
- No, these are two different things, Verilog is not a sequentianl [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language),
but it is a [Hardware Description Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language). Microcontrollers or 
boards based on microcontrollers such as Arduino are processors that perform instructions loaded to their memory. Verilog is used to
build hardware either in an [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) or [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) technology.
